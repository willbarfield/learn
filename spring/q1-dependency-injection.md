# Question 01 - What is dependency injection and what are the advantages?

Dependency Injection is a technique of creating software in which objects do not create their dependencies on itself, instead objects declare dependencies that they need and it is external
object job or framework job to provide concrete dependencies to objects.

Types of Dependency Injection:
- Constructor injection
- Setter injection
- Interface injection

Advantages of using dependency injection is:
- Increases code reusability
- Increases code readability
- Increases code maintainability
- Increases code testability
- Reduces coupling
- Increases cohesion
